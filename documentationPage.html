	<h1>Tyler Gerber Project 1 "Music Fountains"</h1>

		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>My project will be, as the title implies, a Music Fountain. So essentially there will be multiple fountains that are
		controlled by the music that is being played. The music will influence both the speed at which water is sprayed from the
		individual fountains and the amount of water that is sprayed per second. The user will be able to change the color of the particles
		that are sprayed from the fountains via sliders below the canvas that will control the R,G, and B values respectively. I will
		also explore the option of having the user be able to click on the canvas in order to create an explosion of particles as well as 
		potentially allowing the user to upload their own file for the player to play depending on how it might be implemented.</p>
		<h2>Current Progress</h2>
		<p>Currently, I have the full back-end finished for the project. All of the java script classes exist and are functioning
		properly, including the hook-up between the music and the water particle generation. The algorithms for which may change
		before the final version is finished.</p>
		<h2>Inspirations</h2>
		<p>There were two main inspirations for this project. The first was the audio visualizer in class exercise that we did
		a couple of weeks ago (as of writing this). The second source of my inspiration is real-life music fountains where
		the fountains are programmed to fluctuate how much water they are spraying depending on the music that is playing.
		Examples of these fountains can be found all over the internet. For a more detailed description of how they work,
		you can visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_fountain">This Wikipedia Page</a>.</p>
